# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a
harassment-free experience for everyone.

## Our Standards

Examples of behaviour that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Respecting differing viewpoints and experiences
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behaviour include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behaviour and are
expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of
unacceptable behaviour.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces and when an individual is officially
representing the project or its community in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behaviour may be reported by
contacting the project team at maintainers@phantomwire.org. All complaints will be reviewed and
investigated promptly and fairly.
